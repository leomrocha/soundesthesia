This was a demo done for a possible startup project in the European Innovation Academy 2014

The main idea is an online application that can correct in real time the notes played.
The main demo shows a couple of drills with a guitar, it picks the sound with the microphone and does the recognition.

In 2014 MIDI and sound APIs on web browsers did not yet exist (well, chrome started to have a dev beta test on MIDI API)
so was quite a challenge specially for the way that JS threads were treated at the moment (one foregrownd thread with all, and one quite difficult to use background one).


From now on all code that was done by me (so no other license) is under MIT license.
